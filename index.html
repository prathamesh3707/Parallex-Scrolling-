      <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>

      <p>
        A web page or webpage is a document, commonly written in HTML, that is
        viewed in an Internet browser. A web page can be accessed by entering a
        URL address into a browser's address bar. A web page may contain text,
        graphics, and hyperlinks to other web pages and files. A web page is
        often used to provide information to viewers, including pictures or
        videos to help illustrate important topics. A web page may also be used
        as a method to sell products or services to viewers. Multiple web pages
        make up a website, like our Computer Hope website.

        Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website
        background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a
        3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and
        creating a more immersive browsing experience. Parallax is based on
        optical illusion.

        A landing page is a great way to drive traffic, improve your SEO and
        build your brand. It can also form part of an effective PPC strategy.
        Approximately 68% of B2B businesses use landing pages to generate leads
        for future conversion. Fortunately for you, 44% of these clicks are
        directed toward home pages, which, as weâ€™ll discuss, is not a good
        strategy. Landing pages lead customers to a specific product, service or
        offer and encourage them to take action. This is your opportunity to
        create conversions and build your customer base.
